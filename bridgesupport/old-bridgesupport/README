BridgeSupport files are XML files that describe the API symbols of frameworks 
or libraries that cannot be introspected at runtime. These are generally ANSI C
symbols that is, non-object-oriented items such as constants, enumerations, 
structures, and functions but can also include some additional information 
about Objective-C classes, methods, and informal protocols.

The sources are covered under a BSD license (see the COPYRIGHT file for more
