    @class NuCell
    @abstract The building blocks of lists.
    @discussion  NuCells are used to build lists and accept several powerful messages for list manipulation.
    In Lisp, these are called "cons" cells after the function used to create them.

    Each NuCell contains pointers to two objects, which for historical reasons are called its "car" and "cdr".
    These pointers can point to objects of any Objective-C class,
    which includes other NuCells.  Typically, the car of a NuCell points to a member of a list and
    its cdr points to another NuCell that is the head of the remainder of the list.
    The cdr of the last element in a list is nil.
In Nu, nil is represented with the <code>[NSNull null]</code> object.
