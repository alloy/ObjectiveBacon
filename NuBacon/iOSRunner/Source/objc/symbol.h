/*!
    @class NuSymbol
    @abstract The Nu symbol class.
    @discussion Instances of NuSymbol are used to uniquely represent strings in parsed Nu expressions.
    NuSymbol objects are used as keys in local evaluation contexts (typically of type NSMutableDictionary)
    and each NuSymbol may also have a global value bound to it.
    Symbols ending in a colon (':') are considered "labels" which evaluate to themselves without error,
    and when a label is found at the head of the list,
    the list is considered to be a special type of list called a property list.
    Each member of a property list is evaluated and the resulting list is returned with no further evaluation.
