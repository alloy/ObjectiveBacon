This directory contains PCRE source files generated from the official 
PCRE distribution.

These files are included to simplify building Nu on all platforms, 
especially iOS, which currently has limited support for libraries.

When compiling, please be sure to define the following macro:
	-D HAVE_CONFIG_H

See pcre.h for the version number of our PCRE snapshot.

You can update these files from the latest PCRE distribution 
by following these steps:

1. Generate the appropriate config.h using this command (in 
the PCRE directory):

% ./configure --enable-utf8

2. Copy all source files from your local PCRE source directory.

% cd Nu/pcre
% cp /usr/local/src/pcre-8.10/*.[ch] .

3. Remove the sources for any PCRE test and demonstration programs.

% grep "main(" *
dftables.c:int main(int argc, char **argv)
pcredemo.c:int main(int argc, char **argv)
pcregrep.c:main(int argc, char **argv)
pcretest.c:int main(int argc, char **argv)

% rm dftables.c pcredemo.c pcregrep.c pcretest.c

4. Verify that your sources include pcre_chartables.c. This
file is generated automatically by the PCRE build, so if you don't
have it, you can easily get it by running 'make' in your PCRE
directory (after running the 'configure' step noted previously).

% cp /usr/local/src/pcre-8.10/pcre_chartables.c .
