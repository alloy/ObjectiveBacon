= Usage on the iPhone/iPad simulator

* Create a new application target that will be the spec runner
* Remove the NSMainNibFile key-value from the runner app’s Info.plist
* Add to the runner app’s ‘Other Linker Flags’ (so it can find the AppDelegate class): -ObjC -all_load
* Make the runner app link against liNuBacon.a
* Add the NuBacon sources (*.nu) to the runner app’s resources
* Finally, add all the app's sources to the runner app (.h/.m). (There needs to be at least one source file or the app won't start!)
